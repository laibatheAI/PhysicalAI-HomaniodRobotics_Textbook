# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Technical Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Source Accuracy
All technical definitions, scientific claims, and historical facts must be verified from primary or peer-reviewed sources. No speculative or unverified information.

### Clarity & Pedagogical Structure
Writing must be suitable for an academic audience with a computer science background. Explanations must be layered: Concept → Example → Technical Detail → Citation.

### Reproducibility
All processes, algorithms, architectures, and robotics mechanisms must be described with reproducible steps or diagrams. Code snippets must be functional and tested.

### Rigor
Prefer peer-reviewed articles, IEEE papers, ACM publications, reputable books, and official documentation.

### Quality & Citation Standards
Citation Style: APA 7th Edition. Minimum Sources: At least 15 credible sources, minimum 50% peer-reviewed. Plagiarism Tolerance: 0% before submission. Writing Quality: Maintain Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 (clear academic English). Fact Verification: Each factual claim must include an inline citation; All data must be cross-referenced before final export.

### Format & Output Constraints
Word Count: 5,000–7,000 words. Book Structure: Introduction, Core Chapters (3–5), Technical Diagrams/Code, Summary & Future Work, Reference Section. Output Formats: Docusaurus website, PDF with embedded APA citations via Spec-Kit Plus.

## Success Criteria
All claims are fully traceable with APA citations. Zero plagiarism on final PDF export. Content passes scientific fact-checking. High clarity for CS/Robotics students. Book builds successfully in Docusaurus and deploys to GitHub Pages. AI tools (Gemini + Claude Code) follow this constitution consistently.

## Development Workflow
Use Spec-Kit Plus for project management. Follow Docusaurus-based development workflow. Export to PDF via Spec-Kit Plus. Apply peer review process for all technical content.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development activities for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All contributors must adhere to these principles. Any deviation requires explicit approval and documentation. Compliance will be verified during code reviews and content validation processes.
