# Assessment Questions: Physical AI Concepts

## Understanding Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

### Question 1: Conceptual Understanding
Explain the fundamental difference between digital AI and embodied AI. Why is it critical for AI systems to understand physics when operating in the real world? Provide at least three specific examples of scenarios where physics understanding is essential for AI performance.

### Question 2: Application in Robotics
Describe how an embodied AI system would approach the task of picking up a fragile object differently than a traditional digital AI system. Include in your explanation:
- The role of sensor feedback
- The importance of force control
- How physical understanding contributes to safe manipulation

### Question 3: Environmental Grounding
Explain the concept of "environmental grounding" and why it's important for AI systems. How do sensors contribute to this grounding, and what are the different types of sensors that provide this information?

## Physics Concepts for AI

### Question 4: Newtonian Mechanics
Apply Newton's three laws of motion to a robotic manipulation scenario. Describe how each law would influence the robot's behavior when attempting to move an object from point A to point B.

### Question 5: Kinematics vs. Dynamics
Explain the difference between kinematics and dynamics in the context of robotics. Provide an example of when a robot would use forward kinematics and when it would use inverse kinematics.

### Question 6: Friction and Contact
How does understanding friction contribute to successful robotic grasping? Describe the differences between static and kinetic friction and how each affects a robot's ability to grip objects.

## Critical Thinking Questions

### Question 7: Physics Simulation
Discuss the advantages and challenges of using physics simulation for training AI systems. What is the "sim-to-real gap," and how might it affect the transfer of learned behaviors from simulation to reality?

### Question 8: Physics-Informed Learning
Explain how incorporating physical laws directly into machine learning models (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) might improve performance compared to traditional approaches. What are potential limitations of this approach?

## Practical Application

### Question 9: Design Challenge
You are designing an AI system for a robot that needs to navigate through a room with fragile objects. Describe how the robot's understanding of physics would influence:
- Path planning decisions
- Speed and acceleration profiles
- Collision avoidance strategies

### Question 10: Future Implications
How might the principles of Physical AI change the way we design AI systems for real-world applications? Discuss potential impacts on safety, efficiency, and human-AI collaboration.
