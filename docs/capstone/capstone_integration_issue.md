# GitHub Issue: Capstone Integration Testing

## Title: Implement Automated Testing for Capstone Humanoid Robot System

## Description:
Create comprehensive automated tests for the capstone humanoid robot system that integrates all textbook concepts. The tests should validate:

1. **Physical AI Integration**: Verify balance control and physically constrained movements
2. **ROS 2 Communication**: Test node communication and message passing
3. **Perception System**: Validate object detection and sensor fusion
4. **Navigation**: Test path planning with balance constraints
5. **Manipulation**: Verify grasp planning and execution
6. **Voice Interaction**: Test natural language processing and command execution
7. **System Integration**: End-to-end functionality tests

## Context7 Enhancement Request:
- Use Context7 to generate comprehensive test scenarios
- Implement Context7-powered test validation
- Create Context7-enhanced debugging tools

## Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for each subsystem
- Integration tests for subsystem combinations
- System-level tests for complete functionality
- Performance benchmarks
- Safety validation tests

## Acceptance Criteria:
- All subsystems pass individual unit tests
- Integration tests pass with >95% success rate
- System performs complete tasks autonomously
- Safety checks are validated
- Performance meets textbook requirements
