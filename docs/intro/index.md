# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide bridges digital AI concepts with real-world humanoid robot behavior, guiding you from foundational Physical AI concepts to developing a complete simulated humanoid capable of natural interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this textbook, ensure you have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Computer with sufficient resources for robotics simulation (8GB+ RAM, dedicated GPU recommended)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this textbook, you will be able to:
1. Understand the fundamental principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
2. Master ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. Create digital twins using Gazebo and Unity for robot simulation
4. Implement NVIDIA Isaac AI systems for perception and navigation
5. Integrate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) capabilities
6. Build a complete autonomous humanoid robot simulation

## How to Use This Book

This textbook is structured in 6 main modules:
1. **Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence** - Foundational concepts
2. **ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System** - Core framework
3. **Digital Twin Simulation** - Gazebo and Unity
4. **NVIDIA Isaac AI Systems** - Advanced perception
5. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal integration
6. **Capstone Project** - Complete implementation

Each chapter follows the pedagogical structure: Concept → Example → Technical Detail → Citation, ensuring comprehensive understanding with academic rigor.

## Next Steps

Begin with Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI to understand why AI must understand physics and the difference between digital AI and embodied AI.
